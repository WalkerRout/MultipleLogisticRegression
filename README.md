# Multiple Logistic Regression
Multiple Logistic Regression implemented in C++ **from scratch**

C++ stdlib was used in order to perform mathematical operations and to create the vectors/matrix.
Vectors and matrices were represented as n-dimensional std::vectors.

More specific documentation is located in the comments in the "wml.cpp" file.

The test dataset I am currently using is the "framingham_clean.csv" dataset.
