# MultipleLogisticRegression
Multiple Logistic Regression implemented in C++ **from scratch**

I used only default C++ libraries in order to perform mathematical operations and to create the vectors/matrix.
All of the operations performed on the vectors and matrices were written from scratch.

More specific documentation is located in the comments in the "wml.cpp" file.

The test dataset I am currently using is the "framingham_clean.csv" dataset.
